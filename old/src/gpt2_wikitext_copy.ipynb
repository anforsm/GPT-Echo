    "Finally, we use a special `data_collator`. The `data_collator` is a function that is responsible of taking the samples and batching them in tensors. In the previous example, we had nothing special to do, so we just used the default for this argument. Here we want to do the random-masking. We could do it as a pre-processing step (like the tokenization) but then the tokens would always be masked the same way at each epoch. By doing this step inside the `data_collator`, we ensure this random masking is done in a new way each time we go over the data.\n",
